//  DATE:       03/05/2013 
//  SYNOPSIS:   This is an object that contains methods that are used
//              to generate and manipulate application forms.  This is a 
//              biggie and it has LOTs of jQuery sitting behind it. I
//              did a LOT of work on the application forms in a recent
//              project at http://www.croscitydjs.com.au on the Contact
//              Page.  Customer wanted all sorts of dynamic fields, and
//              ALSO wanted to transfer data between forms!  I got it all
//              to work in the end, and it was so nice it deserves to be
//              written up into a module that can be re-used.
